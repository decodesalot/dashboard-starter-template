# Dashboard Starter Template
This is a free, open source, bootstrap 5 starter template. Great for basic prototyping or getting a head start on setting up a portal. 

## Getting Started
Run the following command: 
```
npm i
```
This will generate a `/node_modules` folder and download any package listed in the package.json file.
I kept things basic, keeping true to the bootstrap framework as much as possible. However, I wrote the css in sass and used the `node-sass` package for compiling.

## Note
If you would like to continue making style changes, in your terminal type:
 ```
 npm run sass
 ```
 This will compile your scss and put the css file inside the `/dist/css` folder.
